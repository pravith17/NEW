Of course. Here is the complete, final, and maximally detailed project specification for AURA. This prompt is designed to be a comprehensive guide for mgx.dev, leaving no room for ambiguity and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web and event technology.
Project Specification Document: The AURA Event Experience Engine
 * Project Title: AURA
 * Client: Elite Events (developed by Pravi Managers)
 * Version: 1.0
 * Date: September 6, 2025
1. Vision & Executive Summary
This document outlines the creation of AURA, a revolutionary, world-first Event Experience Engine. AURA is not merely an application; it is a holistic ecosystem designed to fundamentally redefine the interaction between attendees, organizers, and the event environment itself. Our mission is to build a platform so advanced, intuitive, and engaging that it becomes the sole global standard for premier events.
AURA will seamlessly blend the physical and digital worlds, leveraging AI, AR, and Web3 technologies to create hyper-personalized, immersive, and unforgettable experiences. It will be built for infinite scale, airtight security, and feature a breathtaking, fluid user interface that sets a new benchmark in design. This is a "category of one" product.
2. The AURA Design System: "Liquid Aurora"
The user experience must be professional, futuristic, and utterly captivating. We are moving away from common themes to create a unique visual identity.
 * Aesthetic Philosophy: The design will evoke the feeling of interacting with liquid light and energy. It should feel premium, elegant, and technologically advanced. The core theme is a blend of dark matter, liquid metal, and the aurora borealis.
 * Color Palette:
   * Primary Backgrounds: Deep space blue (#0D0F1E), midnight purple (#19132F).
   * Gradients: Subtle, slowly animating aurora gradients (blending teal #00F2FE, magenta #EC008C, and violet #A33BFF) used for backgrounds of cards, headers, and key sections.
   * Accent & CTA: A vibrant, glowing teal (#00F2FE) and a warm magenta (#EC008C).
   * Text: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for headers, off-white/light grey (#E1E1E6) for body text to reduce eye strain.
 * Typography: A clean, modern, sans-serif font family. For instance, Inter or Satoshi, to ensure readability and a professional feel.
 * Core Interactive Elements:
   * Liquid Cursor Effect: This is a critical and defining feature.
     * On Move: The cursor leaves a subtle, shimmering trail of particles, like a comet's tail on a dark canvas.
     * On Hover (Buttons/Links): The element beneath the cursor gently warps as if touched by a finger on a water surface.
     * On Click: A satisfying, concentric ripple effect emanates from the cursor's position, providing visceral feedback.
   * Glassmorphism & Aurora Blur: Modals, sidebars, and cards will use a semi-transparent, blurred background ("frosted glass" effect). Behind this blur, the subtle aurora animations will continue, creating a beautiful sense of depth.
 * Animation & Motion:
   * Page Transitions: Seamless and fluid. No hard cuts. Use fade-through-black or a subtle "warp" effect for transitions.
   * Element Animation: Components will load with gentle, physics-based animations (e.g., floating into place). Charts and graphs will animate as they render.
   * Micro-interactions: Every interactive element (toggles, buttons, icons) will have a refined, non-intrusive animation to acknowledge user input. The "Pravi Managers" logo on the loading screen will materialize from a swirl of liquid particles.

 * 4.6. Sentient Ambiance System (IoT Integration):
   * The platform API will be designed to integrate with smart venue systems (Philips Hue, etc.). It will use real-time data (crowd noise level, pace of check-ins, sentiment from in-app chat) to dynamically adjust lighting color/intensity and ambient music to match and enhance the collective event mood.
 * 4.7. Holographic AI Concierge:
   * The platform will support an API endpoint designed to power on-site holographic displays or AR glasses. This allows for an interactive, 3D AI avatar to act as a futuristic information booth, providing directions and answering questions.
4. Technical Architecture & Non-Functional Requirements
 * Architecture: Microservices-based architecture, fully containerized (Docker) and orchestrated (Kubernetes).
 * Scalability: Engineered to handle 100,000+ concurrent users with low latency. Utilize serverless functions for spiky workloads like QR code generation and notifications.
 * Database: A scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series data, or a multi-model database like FaunaDB).
 * Security: Assume a zero-trust security model. All internal and external communication must be encrypted. Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning are required.
 * Data Privacy: GDPR, CCPA, and global data privacy standards must be adhered to from day one. Data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
 * Deployment:
   * Frontend: Vercel for its global CDN and performance optimizations.
