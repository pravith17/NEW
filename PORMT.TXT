Build a simple event check-in web app.  
Core features:  
1. User registration form (name, email, phone).  
2. Generate unique QR code on registration.  
3. QR scan via camera → auto-mark attendance.  
4. Organizer dashboard: list of registered + present users.  
Keep it fast, clean, minimal UI, no extras.  


Update the current Event Check-In System code.  
Changes needed:  
1. Add option to upload QR code from gallery, in addition to camera scan.  
2. Apply "Pravi Managers" branding: logo placeholder, brand colors, modern typography.  
3. Redesign homepage with a unique, professional layout:  
   - Hero section with title + tagline  
   - Three main cards: Register, Check-in, Dashboard (make them visually distinct with icons, hover effects).  
   - Add a clean footer with "© Pravi Managers".  
4. Make UI polished, responsive, and different from standard templates.  
5. Keep code minimal, efficient, and fast-loading.
