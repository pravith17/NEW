Vibe-Athon 2025 – Problem Statements (Detailed)
Anonymous Confession Wall
College students often want a space to express themselves anonymously, whether it’s funny,
emotional, or lighthearted thoughts. Right now, these end up scattered across Instagram stories,
random WhatsApp groups, or never shared at all. The idea is to centralize anonymous posts into
one “confession wall” where peers can read and react instantly.
- Expected features: anonymous posting, reaction system (likes/emojis), feed-style display.
- Why it matters: Builds a sense of community while protecting identities.
- Difficulty: 4/10
College Meme Board
Memes are the student body’s unofficial language. Every inside joke, exam struggle, and campus
quirk deserves its own spotlight. A meme board allows users to upload memes and vote on their
favorites, creating a leaderboard of the funniest content.
- Expected features: image upload, upvote/downvote system, trending display.
- Why it matters: Boosts engagement, fun, and campus identity.
- Difficulty: 5/10
Lost & Found Portal
Items like water bottles, ID cards, and umbrellas often vanish on campus, never to return. A lost &
found portal digitizes the process: students can post either “lost” or “found” items with short
descriptions and pictures, and others can connect if they’ve seen it.
- Expected features: item posting (lost/found category), search or filter by type.
- Why it matters: Saves time and frustration, reduces “ask around endlessly” problem.
- Difficulty: 5/10
Event Check-In System
At college events, tracking attendance is a headache — sheets get misplaced and manual counts
are slow. A simple digital system where participants register beforehand, get a QR code, and scan
at entry makes check-ins faster and cleaner.
- Expected features: registration, QR generation, scan + mark attendance.
- Why it matters: Improves event management and provides attendance records instantly.
- Difficulty: 6/10
Quick Polls Platform
Organizers often want real-time opinions from students: “Which event timing works best?”, “Favorite
performance?”, “Who should win the fun contest?” A quick polls system allows polls to be created
and voted on instantly, with live results visible.
- Expected features: poll creation, voting, result display.
- Why it matters: Encourages participation and gives event organizers fast feedback.
- Difficulty: 4/10
Study Buddy Finder
Students preparing for exams or projects often struggle to find like-minded peers to study with. A
study buddy finder helps people match based on subject, skill level, or timing, making it easier to
prepare together.
- Expected features: profile creation (subjects), search/match results.
- Why it matters: Builds collaboration, reduces exam stress, promotes peer learning.
- Difficulty: 6/10
Canteen Menu Live
Nobody likes the mystery of “what’s in the canteen today?” A live menu system lets the canteen
update daily dishes and students see it instantly. Students can also rate items (“good” or “bad”),
creating a feedback loop for the kitchen.
- Expected features: daily menu display, rating system.
- Why it matters: Improves food choices, canteen reputation, and reduces wasted food.
- Difficulty: 5/10
Digital Suggestion Box
Students usually hesitate to give feedback directly to faculty or organizers. A digital suggestion box
allows anonymous submissions where students can share their ideas, complaints, or
improvements. Later, suggestions can be reviewed and acted upon.
- Expected features: anonymous submission, suggestion feed.
- Why it matters: Encourages honest input, helps organizers improve future events.
- Difficulty: 4/10
Skill Swap Mini-Market
Many students have skills they can share — photography, coding, dancing — and skills they want
to learn. A mini “marketplace” where students list what they can teach and what they want to learn
allows easy skill exchanges.
- Expected features: skill listings, connect option.
- Why it matters: Promotes peer-to-peer learning, builds networks across domains.
- Difficulty: 6/10
Open Innovation (Wildcard)
Participants are free to innovate and build any MVP that solves a student or community problem not
listed above. This could be something fun, creative, or impactful, as long as it can be built within the
given time. Judges will value originality, feasibility, and presentation
